Cerebrovascular Impact of Type 2 Diabetes in the Elderly â€“ A Multimodal Analysis
 Project Summary:
This project analyzes the CVES dataset to explore how type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) affects cerebral vasoregulation, brain structure, and functional outcomes in elderly individuals. 
The dataset includes multimodal recordings such as transcranial Doppler (TCD), MRI imaging, 24-hour ECG and blood pressure, gait analysis, and metabolic markers from 120 participants (60 with T2DM and 60 controls).
Our analysis focuses on identifying microvascular impairments, altered cerebral perfusion, and neuroanatomical changes linked to T2DM. We apply data cleaning, transformation, 
and visualization using Power BI and SQL, aiming to derive actionable insights on diabetes-related brain health deterioration and cognitive risk.
